<h3>Final Year Project</h3>

This system is a community-driven platform aligned with SDG no.1 that enables those who are affected by the daily hardships and Covid-19 issues to access essential support which consists basic necessities as a short-term solution, job opportunities as long-term solution especially for those who have lost their jobs to the pandemic and alternative access to relevant healthcare.

Subsystem 1 : Basic Necessities <br>
**Subsystem 2 : Job Portal** <br>
Subsystem 3 : Mental Health Appointment <br>

<h3>Job Portal Subsystem</h3>

The second subsystem is a long-term alternative, Job Portal subsystem in which user is able to access job opportunities from the nearest available location through a filter and submit their information details and resume through this platform. Employers are also able to advertise relevant job vacancies. This platform would establish a direct connection between job seekers and employer.
